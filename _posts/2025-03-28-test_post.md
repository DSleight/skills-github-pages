My basic platform is as follows:

Community Engagement & Representation – I am committed to actively listening to and representing the residents of Ward 1, ensuring their voices are heard in city decisions.

Public Safety & Emergency Services – I support strong public safety initiatives that keep our neighborhoods safe while fostering positive relationships between residents and first responders.

Economic Growth & Local Jobs – I will advocate for smart economic development that supports local businesses, creates jobs, and strengthens Westbrook’s economy.

Infrastructure & City Services – I believe in responsible investment in our roads, utilities, and public spaces to improve quality of life and ensure our city’s long-term success.

Fiscal Responsibility & Transparency – I will work to ensure that city resources are managed wisely and that government decisions remain transparent and accountable to the public.
