Dustin Sleight for City Council: Welcome to my Campaign Page
---

Here is where I'll tell you a little about myself:

I have a deep commitment to our community and believe my experiences and skills make me well-suited to represent Ward 1 effectively.
I moved to Westbrook in 2016 after beginning my career at the Sappi paper mill in 2015. In my time as a Westbrook resident, I’ve worked in manufacturing as an engineer and people leader at the mill, at Abbott during the Covid pandemic, and now at IDEXX since 2021, all major employers in our city. These roles have given me insight into the needs of our local workforce and the importance of fostering strong connections between businesses and the community.
My background in leadership began as a student, serving as high school class president, a representative to Maine Dirigo Boys State, and an active member of the Key Club and student council. These early experiences instilled in me an enthusiasm for civic engagement over the years. I’ve continued that commitment through community volunteering as a hockey coach and camp counselor, supporting youth development in sports, engineering, and the performing arts.
I am proud of the growth and development Westbrook has seen in recent years and was encouraged by the vision outlined in Mayor Morse’s inaugural address. I look forward to building on initiatives aimed at fostering economic vitality, strengthening our community, and enhancing quality of life for residents. I would like to add my skill set and collaborative mindset to the existing council to do my part in helping address the complex challenges facing Westbrook and to contribute to its continued progress.
In recent months, I have enjoyed attending city council meetings, reviewing meeting minutes and packets, observing the council at work, and meeting with some of its members to discuss their service and experiences. These experiences have deepened my appreciation for the role of Westbrook’s City Council and strengthened my desire to serve. I am eager to learn and participate, and will do my best to represent my city, my neighbors, neighborhood, and myself with integrity and dedication.
It would be an honor to serve Ward 1 as its city councilor. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my candidacy further and to contribute to the continued growth and success of Westbrook.
